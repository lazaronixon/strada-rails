# Strada for Rails

[Strada](https://strada.hotwired.dev) enables you to create native controls in your hybrid mobile apps, driven by the web. Build web components and native components that work together in `WebView` screens to elevate your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) apps to the next level.

Strada for Rails makes it easy to use [strada-web](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-web) with both import-mapped and JavaScript-bundled apps. It relies on either `importmap-rails` to make Stimulus available via ESM or a Node-capable Rails (like via `jsbundling-rails`) to include Strada in the bundle. Make sure to install one of these first!
